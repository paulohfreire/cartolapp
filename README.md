# Cartola App - A Fantasy League Companion

Welcome to my Cartola project! This project delivers a specialized website, designed as a companion tool for fantasy football enthusiasts using the Cartola FC platform. It offers a centralized, interactive dashboard for league members to manage their teams, track scores, monitor league standings, and participate in custom challenges.
Built using React.js, it aims to provide an engaging and visually appealing experience.

## Core Features:

### Team and League Management:

 View and Manage Teams: Users can access detailed information about their teams, including player statistics and team performance within their specific leagues.
 League Insights: The dashboard provides insights into league standings and updates, helping participants strategize and make informed decisions.
 
### Score and Round Analysis:

Live Scoring: Scores for each match round are updated in real-time, allowing users to see their teamâ€™s performance as the games progress.
Round Summary: At the end of each round, participants can review a detailed breakdown of scores and player performances.

### Internal League Challenges:

Custom Challenges: Users can create and track custom challenges within their league, adding a layer of personalized competition.
Alerts and Notifications: The system sends notifications about upcoming matches and challenge deadlines to keep all league members informed and engaged.

### Prize Tracking:

Prize Details: Information regarding the prizes for the league champion and other rankings are clearly displayed, motivating players to perform their best.
Reward Updates: Updates on the distribution and status of prizes based on league standings are provided throughout the season.

## Technical Specifications:

 Integration with Cartola API: The website uses the Cartola API to pull real-time data regarding team selections, player scores, and league standings directly into the dashboard.
 Responsive Web Design: The site is designed to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
 Enhanced Security: Advanced security measures are implemented to ensure the integrity and privacy of user data and league information.

## How to run:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
